# 🔍 Search Algorithms in Python

This repository showcases the implementation of fundamental **search algorithms** — a core concept in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** — written in clean, beginner-friendly Python. It includes:

- ✅ Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
- ✅ Linear Search (Iterative & Recursive)

These examples are designed to demonstrate my grasp of algorithmic thinking, recursion, iteration, and space/time complexity analysis — essential skills for software development and technical interviews.

## 🧠 About the Algorithms

### 🔹 Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a **sorted** array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (Iterative), O(log n) (Recursive due to call stack)

### 🔹 Linear Search
Linear search checks each element in the list one by one until the target is found. It does not require sorted input.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (Iterative), O(n) (Recursive due to call stack)
