# 🔁 Array Reversal & Rotation in C

This repository contains two fundamental array manipulation programs written in **C** that demonstrate my understanding of basic **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts — specifically array reversal and left rotation.

These operations are commonly asked in technical interviews and form the building blocks for more advanced algorithmic problems.

## 🚀 Programs Included

### 1️⃣ Using TemporaryArray.c

**Description:**  
Reverses the order of elements in an integer array.

**Example:**

Input: 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 5 4 3 2 1


**Concepts Used:**  
- Looping through arrays  
- Temporary storage  
- Index manipulation  

---

### 2️⃣ Rotate one by one.c

**Description:**  
Rotates all elements of an array to the **left by one position**, placing the first element at the end.

**Example:**

Input: 10 20 30 40 50
Output: 20 30 40 50 10


**Concepts Used:**  
- Shifting array elements  
- Basic rotation logic  
- Efficient in-place updates
